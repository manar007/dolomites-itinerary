## Your Ultimate 4-Day Dolomites Itinerary: A Structured Plan with All Your Must-See Locations

This itinerary has been completely redesigned to include all 10 of your requested locations, organized into a clear, day-by-day structure. Each day provides a campsite base, a variety of activities focused on your list, and a scenic drive to your next destination.

### **CRITICAL SPRING TRAVEL ADVISORY (LATE APRIL / EARLY MAY)**

This is the most important part of your plan. Your trip is during the **off-season**, between the winter and summer peaks. Many of the high-altitude locations on your list will be **inaccessible** in the way you might see in summer photos. Please read this carefully:

*   **Cable Cars & Lifts WILL BE CLOSED:** The cable cars for **Seceda**, **Alpe di Siusi**, and the **"Coffin Cable Car" (Passo Pordoi)** will almost certainly be closed. You can drive to the passes and villages below, but you will not be able to get to the famous high-altitude viewpoints via lift.
*   **High-Altitude Roads WILL BE CLOSED:** The toll road to **Tre Cime di Lavaredo (Rifugio Auronzo)** will be closed. You can view the peaks from a distance (e.g., from Lago di Misurina), but you cannot drive up to the base for the famous hike.
*   **Hiking Trails WILL BE SNOW-COVERED:** Trails at **Seceda**, **Alpe di Siusi**, **Tre Cime**, **Cadini di Misurina**, and **Giesler Alm** will have significant snow cover. Hiking them requires winter hiking experience and equipment (microspikes, poles). This itinerary focuses on what is realistically accessible: valley walks, lake circuits, and driving to viewpoints.
*   **Sunrise at Lago di Braies:** This is possible but requires a very early start in the dark. The lake will be beautiful and quiet.

This plan is designed based on what is **realistically possible** in early May, focusing on scenic drives and lower-elevation walks that still offer incredible views.
